      <p>
      A web worker is a JavaScript that runs in the background, 
      independently of other scripts, without affecting the performance of the page. <br/>
      You can continue to do whatever you want: clicking, selecting things, etc., 
      while the web worker runs in the background.
      </p>
    </React.Fragment>
